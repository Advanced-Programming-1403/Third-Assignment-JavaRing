### 3️⃣ Step 3: Implement Player & Monster Methods 🏹  

Each class should have the appropriate attributes and methods.  

✅ Basic Actions:
- **Attacking**: Players and monsters can attack their opponents.
- **Defending**: Reduce or block incoming damage.
- **Being Killed**: When health reaches zero, the entity is defeated.
- **Healing**: Players can heal, and some monsters (not all) have the ability to heal.

✅ Unique Abilities:
Each class of players and monsters has its own unique abilities.

<!-- Specify unique abilities for each class here -->

<br />
🔹 Make sure each entity **prints messages** when performing actions:  

```bash
Arthur (Knight) attacked Goblin!
Goblin took 15 damage!
Goblin has 35 health remaining.
```
