# **Java-Ring** 🎮  
A turned-based RPG inspired by Souls-like games which can be run in terminal

### **Introduction**  
Welcome to **Java-Ring**, a turn-based RPG inspired by Souls-like games! In this assignment, you will develop a **text-based role-playing game (RPG)** that follows a structured combat system where players engage in battles against powerful monsters. This project is designed to reinforce your understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles**, including *inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces*.  

Your task is to implement a class hierarchy for different game entities, including **players and monsters**, each with unique abilities and attributes. By the end of this project, you will have a *functional game system* where players can **fight monsters in a turn-based combat system**, reinforcing your understanding of *OOP design* in a practical way.

### **Game Concept**  
Java-Ring is a turn-based game where players take on the role of powerful warriors, each wielding unique weapons, and face off against fearsome monsters in combat. Both players and monsters have their own **health, attack power, and special abilities**. The game progresses through **turn-based battles**, where each entity (player or monster) attacks in sequence until one is defeated.

### **What is a Turn-Based Game?**  
In this combat system, two sides - which are usually the player's side and the enemy's side - attack each other in turns. The side which is not attacking can perform actions to avoid or deflect the enemy's attack.

### **Core Mechanics:**  
✅ **Turn-based combat** – Players and monsters take turns attacking each other.  
✅ **Weapons system** – Each player and monster **must** have at least one weapon. (For extra points, students can implement multiple weapons per entity.)  
✅ **Character classes** – Players can choose from different warrior archetypes, such as **Knight, Assassin, or Wizard**, each with unique abilities.  
✅ **Monsters with special attacks** – Monsters like **Dragons, Goblins, and Skeletons** have distinct attack patterns.  
✅ **Damage system** – Each weapon deals a specific amount of damage, reducing the opponent’s health.  
✅ **Battle to the death** – The combat continues until one side is completely defeated.  

### **How the Game Works**  
1️⃣ The player selects a character class.  
2️⃣ A random monster opponent is generated.  
3️⃣ Both entities **take turns attacking** each other.  
4️⃣ The battle ends when one entity’s health reaches **zero**.  
5️⃣ (Optional) Players can switch weapons during combat if multiple weapons are implemented.  

By completing this assignment, you will develop a **fully functional RPG battle system** that demonstrates key OOP concepts while allowing for creativity in design.
